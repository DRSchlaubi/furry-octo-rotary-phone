# forp-analyze-api

This is the API for the forp analyze module which is implemented
by [core](https://github.com/DRSchlaubi/furry-okto-rotary-phone/tree/main/forp-analyze/forp-analyze-core)
and [client](https://github.com/DRSchlaubi/furry-okto-rotary-phone/tree/main/forp-analyze/forp-analyze-client)

It's recommended for libraries which don't want to be bound to a specific implementation of the analyzer like [AutoHelp](https://github.com/bankobotv14/BankoBot/tree/feature/autohelp/autohelp)
